						<p>I'm going to be honest here, I am not the biggest fan of New
						Years Resolutions. Don't get me wrong, I think the idea of
						identifying areas for self-improvement and working
						towards those goals is great, I just think waiting for
						a calendar to tell you "it's time to improve yourself"
						is a bit silly. However, I do think the New Years at least
						provides a time to sit back and reflect, especially since
						it is around this time that people, myself included, have
						some time off and therefore can spend time reflecting.
						I've decided this year to publish my New Years Resolutions,
						mostly so I have a tangible and public set of goals, so
						anyone that reads this and knows me can hold me accountable to these resolutions. Also, I frankly do not remember what
						my resolutions last year were, so having them easily accessible
						should increase my chances of actually doing them.</p>

						<p>Without further ado, let's jump into my New Years Resolutions for 2018.<p>
						<ol>
						<li> <strong>Consume less, create more.</strong> I do not
						consider myself a procrastinator. In fact, I am pretty good
						at getting things done well before they need to be done.
						However, I am quite adept at wasting time. Too much of
						my day is spent consuming content that adds no real
						value to my life. Youtube and Netflix are the worst offenders here, with
						Facebook and Snapchat being close runner-ups. A simple
						way to achieve this goal would be to remove myself from
						those platforms, but I do not see that as realistic. There are
						very good things those platforms have to offer, I just need
						to be better at practicing moderation. More tangibly, 
						I need to not use them just as a means to kill time. What
						do I plan on doing with all the time I'll be getting back?
						Well, create more, whatever that may look like. This
						website is a great start, so maintaining and growing it
						out will be a good way to work towards this goal. Getting back
						into writing music, and maybe this time actually record some
						of it, will also be valuable in achieving this goal.
						Continuing to work on the <i>projmanr</i> R package and
						<i>Super Smash Bros. SE</i> game mod will also be productive as well.</li>

						<li><strong>Invest more in people.</strong> I admit it,
						I can be a bit of a workaholic. For easily the past decade
						of my life, school has been the most important aspect
						of my life, especially my last four years in college.
						This emphasis on my education has really led me
						to neglect the people in my life, especially my group
						of friends.
						But I am really starting to see that while learning is
						incredibly important, school itself really isn't. Well,
						let me rephrase that. Certain very time-consuming
						aspects of school, like grades, really aren''t that important.
						My time would be much better spent ensuring that I have
						learned the material, and not worrying that much about
						grades at all. All the time I can save here can be reinvested
						in the people around me. And even if I am not 
						successful in truly convincing myself to put less time into
						my schoolwork, there is still a whole lot of wasted time
						in my life (see 1), that I can get a hold of and redirect to
						the people that I care about (and even finding new people
						to care about!).
						</li>
						<li><strong>Change the way I eat food.</strong> No, I am not
						going on a diet. This resolution has nothing to do with what
						or how much I eat, but rather <i>why</i> I eat. I am very happy
						with my weight and overall think I have a pretty strong diet. 
						But I do, far too often, find myself eating for reasons other than
						"I'm hungry." The most sinister of these is eating out of habit.
						If I normally get a milkshake from Five Guys on Mondays, then
						I often find myself getting a milkshake from Five Guys on Mondays, even if I am not hungry in the least! These patterns
						are going to be hard to break, but ultimately it is very important
						that I do it now, when my metabolism is still forgiving. There
						are other reasons for eating, like stress, boredom, or socializing
						that I hope to break, but if I can eradicate habitual eating, I will
						consider this resolution a success. </li>
						</ol>

						<p>So there they are. I intentionally left my resolutions a little bit vague, without too many specific ways to achieve them. This is because my life at the moment can be so sporadic that I
						think getting to nitty-gritty with my resolutions will sharply
						decrease my chance of attaining them. I intend to post
						updates as the year progresses. Happy New Year!
