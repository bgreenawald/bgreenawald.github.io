                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm very excited to be launching the project I've been working on over the summer, Natural Language Playground (NLPLayground). Many of the personal projects I work on tend to revolve around NLP in some way and I've long wished to make the models available for users to interact with live. NLPlayground is the realization of that goal, making live versions of a variety of models and algorithms publically available. As noted on the homepage of the application, many of the models and algorithms here are not original and I have done my best to cite my inspirations where ever I can. However, these are my implementation of these processes and making them live in this way is not something that I have seen before.
                </p>

                <h3>Projects</h3>

                <p>
                    At launch, the NLPlayground has three primary projects. Currently, I have no plans to add other projects, but rather to add content to the existing ones. However, now that I have the infrastructure in place to make these projects available, I will be on the lookout for new things to add.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first of the three is a MadGab-er. For those unaware, Madgab is a game where users are presented with common phrases that have been "MadGab"-ed and need to guess the original phrase. MadGab is based on mondegreens, which are, according to Google, "misunderstood or misinterpreted words or phrase resulting from a mishearing of the lyrics of a song." A Madgab clue is a collection of words that when said in the right way, actually sound like something else. For example, the phrase "Wander Her Womb Hen," when said in the right way, sounds like "Wonder Women."
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's a very fun game and ever since playing it, I've always thought it would be cool to have an algorithm that can take any phrase and turn it into a MadGab. The algorithm I present isn't exactly that, however it is close enough to get the same effect. I call it RadGab. Whereas in MadGab the clues are real English words, RadGab clues are gibber-ish that when said in the right way, sound like an English phrase. I will write a full blog post soon on the algorithm that I have come up with and I am also working with a friend on a full-fledged online version of the game, which should be live also be live soon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second of the three projects is Markovian Mix and Mash. This is my implementation of the <a href="https://genesisofkanye.tumblr.com/">Random Kanye</a> project, which used a Markov chain to mash together Kanye West streets and Bible verses. I already have a two (<a href="https://bgreenawald.github.io/blog/2018/markov-text-gen.html">1</a>, <a href="https://bgreenawald.github.io/blog/2018/markov-text-gen2.html">2</a>) full blogs post up about the project, so I will not go into any details here. The project that is already live allows you to mix Trump tweets and Bible verses. It is fairly easy for me to add new models (note, it does not have to be only two data sets, I can mash together an arbitrary amount) so I am certainly open to suggestions!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The final project is Neural Network (NN) text generation. This project uses an <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/">implementation</a> of the char-rnn developed by Andrew Karpathy based on his famous post, <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks."</a> It allows for the generation of new text based on a set of input data. For example, one of the models can generate new boy names based on a set of 1000 popular boy names. At launch, the available models will be boy names, girl names, dinosaur names, and Pokemon names. Again, it is fairly easy for me to add new models given a homogenous set of data with at least 1000 observations, so ideas for new ones are welcome!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code for each of the individual projects is open source and available on my <a href="https://github.com/bgreenawald">Github</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Architecture</h3>

                <p>
                    For the technically inclined, this section will go over the architecture used for this project. I knew from the start I wanted a Lambda based architecture to minimize my hosting costs for the project. Initially, I wanted to go completely serverless and use the browser SDK for AWS to call my Lambda functions directly. But after trying a couple of different methods, this became too much of a security risk. I would either have to include API keys in the client code or mess around with user authentication, which seemed like overkill for this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then transitioned to just use a Flask backend to call all of my Lambdas to avoid any security risks and not have to mess with authentication. I also found that you can host a Flask project on Heroku virtually for free. Since the backend need only make API calls and doesn't have to do any actual computation on its own, this should be a robust enough solution assuming the site doesn't get too popular. This also allowed me to utilize jinja2 templates, making the process of adding new projects very easy. The front end just used a premade template from HTML5 UP.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had the site done with this architecture and nearly ready to go before realizing that I had 2 fairly major design errors. The first was that Flask is a synchronous framework and since my Lambda function calls take a little bit of time, I realized I was quickly going to get some performance throttling, since the number of concurrent users I could reasonably handle was equal to the number of cores in my host CPU. I decided to tackle this in two ways. The first was to use Lambda warming to minimize the risk of cold starts for my functions. This entailed having another Lambda function which called all three of the other Lambda functions every 15 minutes. The second was to convert my Flask framework to Quart, an asynchronous version of Flask. Despite causing a slight increase in price to keep the Lambdas warm and a slight increase in difficulty deploying Quart, these changes were necessary to ensure consistent performance of the application. The application is deployed using Heroku.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>

                <p>
                    I am extremely excited to get this project launched and for people to get to interact with NLP in a (hopefully) fun way. As for the future, I intend to keep adding to the existing models as I get ideas and/or suggestions. If new projects come along, those will be added as well. So please reach out with any comments or suggestions, and enjoy the NLPlayground!
                </p>
