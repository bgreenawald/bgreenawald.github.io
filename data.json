[{"name": "Introduction Blog", "content": "<p>Here we are, my very first blog post. The main objective of\nthis post is to give a little taste of who I am as a person\nand also motivate the existence of this site.</p>\n\n<p>So who am I? Well, at risk of plagiarising my own Linked-In profile, I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia\ncurrently pursuing my Masters in Data Science. I chose to pursue this degree as I saw Data Science as the most cutting-edge manifestation of the subjects I studied as an undergrad\n(I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics with a concentration in Probability and Statistics, also at the University of Virginia). I will complete\nthis degree in May 2018, so I am also going through the trials\nand tribulations of a first-time job seeker. That being said, I do\nnot want to get into too much more detail about myself here,\nbecause that is what this site is about! Exploring it should give\nyou a relatively complete picture of who I am and what I am\nall about.</p>\n\n<p>So why exactly am I making a site for myself? I've listed\na few compelling reasons on the homepage of this site,\nbut really the motivation for this site came from enough\npeople telling me that it would be a good idea to have\na personal site. I put off making one for various reasons,\nbut once I discovered that I already used (Github), had\na mechanism for hosting static websites for free (Github Pages),\nI was officially out of excuses. I can think of a few additional reasons beyond what has already been listed. I think the exercise of publishing content could very well change the way\nI interact with the world. Whenever I am undergoing some\ninteresting or challenging problem in my life, I can view it through the lens of something that can be written up and\nposted to the world. I imagine that this will\nhelp me engage with the world around me. Publishing is also\na good mechanism to help hold myself accountable. My next\nblog post is going to involve my 2017-2018 New Years resolutions and the hope is that putting them out in a more\npermanent way online will help me to actually remember and\nfollow through on them.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly do I want this site to be? At the end of the day,\nI just it to be the most complete digital picture of myself out\nthere, and one that I have complete and total control over.\nBeyond that, I do not know what this site could become. Most\nnotably, I do not want to set any sort of goal or theme for this\nblog. It will certainly contain updates on my Capstone research\nand experience as a first-time job hunter, but I do not want to\nlimit myself to those things. This is really an outlet to share\nanything in my life that I think others might find useful.</p>\n\n<p>Will that in mind, I hope that you will explore the rest of my site and I can't wait to see how this project evolves!</p>", "date": "12/23/2017", "location": "blog/2017/introduction.php"}]
