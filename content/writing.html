                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Existence</strong><br>12/5/15</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>A ship spoke to its captain,</em><br>
                        <em>&ldquo;O my captain, the water, it&rsquo;s inescapable&rdquo;</em><br>
                        <em>&ldquo;Always seeping into my sides, rocking me back and forth, never a relief&rdquo;</em><br>
                        <em>&ldquo;A perpetual state of discomfort, I do not belong in the water&rdquo;</em><br>
                        <em>Stunned, the captain responded that he would find a solution.</em><br>
                        <em>But behind the composed face he put on, he knew,</em><br>
                        <em>There was no solution for the problem his ship faces.</em><br>
                        <em>Late that night he goes to the gallows of the ship.</em><br>
                        <em>For the gunpowder reserves reside there.</em><br>
                        <em>A flickering glow is the last he sees of his ship.</em><br>
                        <em>He lets the light fall from his hands before slipping off the vessel,</em><br>
                        <em>Escaping into the icy expanse of the ocean. </em><br>
                        <em>Death is never a pretty thing, but as his ship went up in flames,</em><br>
                        <em>The captain could not help but be reminded of life&rsquo;s beauty.</em><br>
                        <em>When the final flames were consumed by the aqueous void,</em><br>
                        <em>The captain floated; a newfound serenity rippled through the waves.</em><br>
                        <em>His ship did not exist in this world anymore, not physically at least </em><br>
                        <em>But though its carcass littered the ocean floor,</em><br>
                        <em>Its essence now occupied the ocean in its entirety.</em><br>
                        <em>In life, the ship had believed that it did not belong in the water,</em><br>
                        <em>But the captain, wise from his years, knew this not the case.</em><br>
                        <em>For the ship did belong in the water, all ships do.</em><br>
                        <em>But the physical body of the ship served as a barrier for its spirit.</em><br>
                        <em>Allowed only to float on the water and never be a part of it. </em><br>
                        <em>In death, the ship occupied the full expanse of the sea.</em><br>
                        <em>No more limits, no more sadness.</em><br>
                        <em>The captain shed tears as the ocean lit aglow. </em><br>
                        <em>The soul of his ship was finally home,</em><br>
                        <em>At peace with the current. &nbsp;</em></p>

                        10/13/15</p>
                    <p>She always wondered what would happen if you peeled back the sky. She had often watched the paint peel off the walls in her home when she was younger, but what about the sky? The sky was just wallpaper for the Earth, wasn&rsquo;t it? Timidly, she hovered off of the ground and ascended towards the deep blue. She scanned her horizons, looking for any knick or laceration in the sky. Nothing. Flawlessly smooth. She continued her pursuit. Over top of the stormy ocean, she saw a bolt of lightning strike. Tracing the source of the electric pulse, she found exactly what she was looking for. A small tear in the sky. She began to peel back. It was exactly like peeling off dried glue, just on a much larger scale. Bits of torn off sky were now beginning to decorate the ocean floor. She gazed, in awe, but simultaneously not the least bit surprised. She had finally found it. Valhalla, hidden from us the entire time. Right behind the sky, waiting for an inquisitive mind like hers to finally uncover it.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Bar</strong><br>10/15/15</p>
                    <p>The bar seemed somehow more lonely that night than usual. The regulars were all there. The 50 something man who chain-smoked&nbsp;at the booth alone. The 25 year old law student who used the bar as a way to escape her studies. And then, of course, the stay at home mom whose presence at the bar was both enigmatic and highly concerning to the other regulars.</p>
                    <p>Now I&rsquo;m truly alone at the bar. The regulars have since left. The bartender implied last call with his eyes but the bar&rsquo;s official closing time wasn&rsquo;t for another hour so there wasn&rsquo;t much he could do. My father always searched for answers at the bottom of the glass, why shouldn&rsquo;t I at least give it a shot. The opaqueness of my whiskey leaves the element of surprise. The answer could still be there. Guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Immortals</strong><br />10/19/15</p>
                    <p>Jonah had been meaning to do it for some time. It was sort of a Hajj amongst his people. A coming of age. You weren&rsquo;t truly a man until you&rsquo;d visited the immortals. Despite its grandiosity, visiting the immortals was actually a trivially easy task. They resided in a rock face just a days travels from the village. They weren&rsquo;t violent. There was really no danger associated with going to see them. But the hardship came with what they told you. Being immortal means years of developing a cynicism for the world. You learn things. You see generations upon generations make the same mistakes; give into the same evils. For such an intelligent species, humans are such slow learners. He still had an optimistic outlook on life and wasn&rsquo;t sure he was ready to see life through the eyes of the immortal. Maybe tomorrow he would. Just not today.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ah! How beautiful she is, gazing at the mountain laced horizon</em><br /><em>Framed exquisitely by the ethereal meadow</em><br /><em>Her sky eyes accented by the midday sunlight</em><br /><em>A placid breeze causing minute ripples in her lustrous hair.</em></p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Her morning laughter has the gaiety of flowers.</em><br /><em>Her nights of dark contemplation illuminate the essence of life itself.</em><br><em>One could not count the moons that shimmer in her eyes, </em><br><em>or know the thousand splendid suns that hide behind them.</em></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>And as I watch her, I desire only to understand her</em><br><em>But accept the sheer good fortune in simply knowing her</em><br><em>And I love her, </em><br><em>for knowing her and loving her are one in the same.</em></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Grip&nbsp;</strong><br>10/27/17</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">If ever you encounter something or someone in this life that ignites sparks deep within you,<br>
                        that makes you happy, truly happy,<br>
                        you must latch onto it with a vice grip that would make Hercules himself envious,<br>
                        grasp it will every part of your soul, every corner of your being, and prepare for the ride.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">It will try and shake you off,<br>
                        maintain your grip.<br>
                        It will toss you around, drag you along, and throw you to the ground,<br>
                        grasp it harder.<br>
                        Hold on until your finger burn and your knuckles white,<br>
                        and expel any thought of relaxing your grip.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">If you can, along the way, grab onto others,<br>
                        bring them along on your journey,<br>
                        allow them to indulge&nbsp;in the tailwinds of your happiness,<br>
                        But should the weight of others cause your grasp to falter,<br>
                        release them immediately.<br>
                        For your happiness is your own and if ever you let it slide through your fingers,<br>
                        it may just escape for good.</p>

                    <p>
                        I stared at the pills, and the pills stared back. Not literally of course, though at this point it wouldn’t take me by much surprise. In my 500 years, I’ve seen many a strange technology come and go. Walls that could actually talk were a short-lived, albeit amusing, architectural phenomena. Robots whose entire purpose was to engage you in small talk was another. But not yet pills that could stare back. And I consider myself lucky that I intend to End my life before I ever have to see sentient pills come into existence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In reality, they never will for the simple fact that pills don’t exist anymore outside of Ending. Medicine is almost entirely controlled by the chip implanted at the base of your neck at birth. In extreme cases where your chip is not suitable, nano-medicine is administered through aerosols. No, pills don’t really have any place in this universe anymore, except of course for Ending. Ending was simply too important an act to leave to chance. The Inventors decided that ingesting physical pills was a good way to eliminate any accidental Ending. I myself am not a fan of Ending in general. Had a been alive for the great debate, I would have been on the side of the Natural Lifers. But in the end the great debate wasn’t much of a debate at all and only a couple of years after the conception of the LifeChip, every newborn was implanted one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The LifeChip was truly a revolution and it represented a total victory for human beings over, well, life. Imagine for a second someone so good at a given task, that they quite literally seem above it. A mathematics Ph.D. who goes back to elementary school algebra, or a professional athlete who plays a game with someone who hasn’t performed cardiovascular exercise in years. This is how humans became with living. Medicine had seen it all and the LifeChip represented the amalgamation of every medical advance since the beginning of time. Once implanted in a person, they simply did not die. The LifeChip prevented any disease, defect, or anomaly and completed nullified aging. Add that to the fact that prosthetics became so good that even people victims of the most horrible accidents could be completely repaired and you’re left with people who simply did not expire.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An interesting fact about dying though that people soon discovered: dying seems like the most horrible thing in the universe until you lose the ability to do it. One prescient LifeChip engineer realized this fact and argued for a kill switch. The other engineers, and more importantly, the government backers, agreed with the condition that the kill switch be impossible to accidentally activate. With this condition at hand, the engineer designed a physical pill as the solution. Even before the LifeChip, physical pills were entirely phased out, meaning the only pills in the universe would be the for the kill switch. Curiously, these pills did not contain any deadly chemical or compounds. Instead, they contained a 1024 bit key unique to the person taking them and a micro-transmitter that would transmit the code upon hitting human stomach acid. At any time, when a person felt like they had lived the life that they wanted to live, they could apply to get their pills. Dying was now a choice in Pangeall and for humans all over the universe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an aside, I once heard a tale about the origin of the name Pangeall. Billions of years ago there existed a supercontinent called Pangea. When the continents once again merged in terrestrial harmony, people were at a loss for what to call it. Many people used the temporary name “Pangea Two” written “Pangea ll”. Eventually, people just started to omit the space and call if Pangeall. I don’t know if it’s true, but to honest, the reality isn’t important to me. I’ve found that sometimes it’s necessary to accept non-truths as truths in order to maintain any sort of enjoyment of life. I imagine that this is why religion stuck around for so long, at least until people got LifeChips and happiness was regulated electronically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ability to never die caused a drastic change in both human psyche and philosophy. I got a first-hand glimpse of this during my career as a Cloudscraper. Well, career might be a bit of an overstatement. It&rsquo;s more like a hobby that I occasionally got rewarded for. For those less inclined, Cloudscrapers poke around public areas of the Galactic Cloud Storage for anything interesting. Since much of the data in the Galactic Cloud is public, anyone with an interest can explore around in it. But with Yottabytes of data being added daily, most people don&rsquo;t bother to look around. However, if you know where to look, there is a literal never-ending pool of information to keep you entertained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through this work, I got an intimate glimpse into the lives of the people I Scraped. Unsurprisingly, one common activity before people Ended was to leave some sort of digital memoir of both their lives and their reasoning for Ending. Most Cloudscrapers ignore these, deeming them useless, but I found them both interesting and strangely beautiful. Through the lucid eyes of death, people reveal their most uninhibited selves. I probably read 1000&rsquo;s of the notes, but only one has stuck with to this day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was from a woman named Aanelie. Aanelie had been working as a medical professional her entire career, which thus far had spanned almost 300 years. At the time, people were allowed to retire after 200 years working, but because she loved it so much Aanelie kept working pro-bono and had been for 75 years. Then came the LifeChip, immediately rendering any health profession obsolete. Aanelie had nothing to worry about though, she had technically retired and could live comfortably with her family and friends for the remainder of her days, which were now infinite.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        It only took 6 months for the reality to settle in; her life was now vacuous. She loved her husband and her children and the friends she had known for centuries, but she was living a life with no purpose, and that ate away at her. Finally, she activated the Emotional Regulator, an optional feature of LifeChip that promised happiness all the time. In fact, the feature worked as promised and her mood was lifted immediately. However, it was obvious that the happiness the chip provided did not penetrate to the level of meaning. Aanelie details how she would lie in bed, lethargic, for days on end. Her husband would come in at noon to find her staring off into space, an all-encompassing smile glued to her face. Two months later, the facade caved in, and in dramatic fashion. She switched off the Emotional Regulator, allowing herself to feel the despondency in full force. She immediately applied for an End, but was rejected. Ends were not allowed for people under the age of 300, especially those with the lavish and fruitful life that she had. In the closing sentences of her autobiography of sorts, she details her plan to gouge the chip from her spine. In the final sentence of her memoir, and what I assume to be the last thing she ever communicated, she writes "Empty happiness in the true nature of sadness".
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        I think this story has stuck with me so long because, in some ways, Aanelie reminds me of my wife, Lilana. When I read of Aanelie&rsquo;s sheer dedications to the people in her life and the insatiable need for meaning, it felt acutely familiar. I realized that it felt familiar because I live it in the form of Lilana. Lilana and I, somewhat embarrassingly, met through the Galactic Connection program. The idea of being set up with a Partner by any sort of governing entity initially made my stomach churn, but the technology was none-the-less impressive. Using the resources available at the Galactic Government, they were able to upload my entire personality via NeuraLink. From there, they could simulate thousands of lives with billions of candidate partners from across the Universe. After the process was complete, I got paired with Lilana. In our 10,000 simulations, we lived stellar lives together in 9,997 of them, we separated in 2 of them, and she only tried to kill me in 1 of them. Pretty good odds if you ask me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unsurprisingly, the odds worked out. We truly did live a stellar life together. Many of my friends wondered why we only chose to have each other. It&rsquo;s been common practice for hundreds of thousands of years to have many partners. With access to an entire universe, one person just wasn&rsquo;t enough for most people anymore. But we were happy with just each other. I&rsquo;ve always thought that the only real benefit to having a Partner is to have someone who understands you more than anyone else in the universe. In that way, they can become an extension of you. Like a prosthetic limb, only one that can make you smile and laugh and think that life in an otherwise meaningless existence is worth living. I truly hope that the people who choose to spread themselves out amongst multiple Partners feel that level of completion, but I don&rsquo;t think they do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So why am I Ending, why now? Because last night I watched the only person I care about in the universe die. I know,  I just said
                        that people didn&rsquo;t die anymore. She didn&rsquo;t die, my Lilana, not technically at least. But through some cruel cosmic joke, I&rsquo;ll never be able to see her again. And that&rsquo;s just not pessimism, that&rsquo;s a universal truth. See, I write this at the peak of the Great Expanse. Scientists have known for millions of years that the Universe is expanding, and they&rsquo;ve known that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They knew that there would be a point at which galaxies themselves would be forced apart from one another and once they starting moving apart at light speed, there would be no chance of ever seeing any other galaxies again. But even having known this for millions of years, we got the when of it wrong. Everyone knew from the dimming lights in the sky that we were close, but not this close.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was only a month ago that the first star in the sky disappeared. Since then, all but one have followed suit, our closest neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, remained the last light in the night sky, other than the moon of course. That&rsquo;s where Lilana was. She had gone to visit her sister. I would&rsquo;ve gone with her, I should&rsquo;ve gone with her, but a year-long trip just didn&rsquo;t appeal to me after living this long and going on hundreds of such adventures. And now I&rsquo;m damned for it. Ever since the first star took its bow, I worried that she wouldn&rsquo;t make it back in time. My worries proved justified. Last night, the last light burned out. Now the sky is empty. Now I&rsquo;m empty. Knowing that the last thing I care about in this infinite universe is forever separated from me by some arbitrary rules of reality. When the last light went out, so did I.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, this is my note. The last thing I will ever produce after 500 years of life. I just took the pill before writing this final paragraph. I don&rsquo;t know how long it takes, but I&rsquo;ve been told that it begins with feeling extreme fatigue and from there you just fall asleep. I wish I could end this with something meaningful, something profound. I had hoped that impending death would inspire some final wisdom, but I as I feel my eyelids grow heavy, I can recall only two things: my life with Lilana, and the album name from some old music, millions of years old at the time, that I came across during my last day of work: "What a terrible world, what a beautiful world."
