                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Existence</strong><br>12/5/15</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>A ship spoke to its captain,</em><br>
                            <em>&ldquo;O my captain, the water, it's inescapable&rdquo;</em><br>
                            <em>&ldquo;Always seeping into my sides, rocking me back and forth, never a relief&rdquo;</em><br>
                            <em>&ldquo;A perpetual state of discomfort, I do not belong in the water&rdquo;</em><br>
                            <em>Stunned the captain responded that he would find a solution.</em><br>
                            <em>But behind the composed face he put on, he knew.</em><br>
                            <em>There was no solution for the problem his ship faces.</em><br>
                            <em>Late one night he goes to the gallows of the ship.</em><br>
                            <em>For he knows the gunpowder reserves reside there.</em><br>
                            <em>A flickering glow is the last he sees of his ship.</em><br>
                            <em>He lets the light fall from his hands before slipping off the vessel,</em><br>
                            <em>Escaping into the icy expanse of the ocean. </em><br>
                            <em>Death is never a pretty thing, but as his ship went up in flames,</em><br>
                            <em>The captain could not help but be reminded of life&rsquo;s beauty.</em><br>
                            <em>When the final flames were consumed by the aqueous void,</em><br>
                            <em>The captain floated; a newfound serenity rippled through the waves.</em><br>
                            <em>His ship did not exist in this world anymore, not physically at least </em><br>
                            <em>But though its carcass littered the ocean floor,</em><br>
                            <em>Its essence now occupied the ocean in its entirety.</em><br>
                            <em>In life, the ship had believed that it did not belong in the water,</em><br>
                            <em>But the captain, wise from his years, knew this not the case.</em><br>
                            <em>For the ship did belong in the water, all ships do.</em><br>
                            <em>But the physical body of the ship served as a barrier for its spirit.</em><br>
                            <em>Allowed only to float on the water and never be a part of it. </em><br>
                            <em>In death, the ship occupied the full expanse the sea.</em><br>
                            <em>No more limits, no more sadness.</em><br>
                            <em>The captain shed tears as the ocean lit aglow. </em><br>
                            <em>The soul of his ship was finally home,</em><br>
                            <em>At peace with the current. &nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Sky</strong><br>
                            10/13/15</p>
                            <p>She always wondered what would happen if you peeled back the sky. She had often watched the paint peel off the walls in her home when she was younger, but what about the sky? The sky was just wallpaper for the Earth, wasn't it? Timidly, she hovered off of the ground and ascended towards the deep blue. She scanned her horizons, looking for any knick or laceration in the sky. Nothing. Flawlessly smooth. She continued her pursuit. Over top of the stormy ocean, she saw a bolt of lightning strike. Tracing the source of the electric pulse, she found exactly what she was looking for. A small tear in the sky. She began to peel back. It was exactly like peeling off dried glue, just on a much larger scale. Bit of torn off sky were now beginning to decorate the ocean floor. She gazed, in awe, but simultaneously not the least bit surprised. She had finally found it. Valhalla, hidden from us the entire time. Right behind the sky, waiting for an inquisitive mind like hers to finally uncover it.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Bar</strong><br>10/15/15</p>
                            <p>The bar seemed somehow more lonely that night than usual. The regulars were all there. The 50's man who chain-smoked&nbsp;at the booth alone. The 25 year old law student who used the bar as a way to escape his studies. And then of course, the stay at home mom whose presence at the bar was both enigmatic and highly concerning to the other regulars. I&rsquo;m alone at the bar. The regulars had left. The bartender implied last call with his eyes but the bars official closing time wasn't for another hour so there wasn't much he could do. My father always searched for answer at the bottom of the glass, why shouldn't I at least give it a shot. The opaqueness of my whiskey leaves the element of surprise. The answer could still be there. Guess we&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Immortals</strong><br />10/19/15</p>
                            <p>Jonah had been meaning to do it for some time. It was sort of a Hajj amongst his people. A coming of age. You weren't truly a man until you'd visited the immortals. Despite its grandiosity, visiting the immortals was actually a trivially easy task. They presided in a rock face just a days travels from the village. They weren't violent. There was really no danger associated with going to see them. But the hardship came with what they told you. Being immortal means years of developing a cynicism for the world. You learn things. You see generations upon generations make the same mistakes; give into the same evils. For such an intelligent species, humans are such slow learners. He still had an optimistic outlook on life and wasn't sure he was ready to see life through the eyes of the immortal. Maybe tomorrow he would. Just not today.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Her</strong><br />(Based on the poem &ldquo;Kabul&rdquo; by Mirza Muhammed Ali Saib)<br />9/25/17</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ah! How beautiful she is, gazing at the mountain laced horizon</em><br /><em>Framed exquisitely by the ethereal meadow</em><br /><em>Her features accented by the midday sunlight</em><br /><em>A placid breeze causing minute ripples in her lustrous hair.</em></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Her morning laughter has the gaiety of flowers.</em><br /><em>Her nights of dark contemplation illuminate the essence of life itself.</em><br><em>One could not count the moons that shimmer in her eyes, </em><br><em>or grasp the thousand splendid sun that hide behind them.</em></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>And as I watch her, I desire only to understand her</em><br><em>But accept the sheer good fortune in simply knowing her</em><br><em>And I love her, </em><br><em>for knowing her and loving her are one in the same.</em></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Grip&nbsp;</strong><br>10/27/17</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">If ever you encounter something or someone in this life that ignites sparks deep within you,<br>
                            that makes you happy, truly happy,<br>
                            you must latch onto it with a vice grip that would make Hercules himself envious,<br>
                            grasp it will every part of your soul, every corner of your being, and prepare for the ride.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">It will try and shake you off,<br>
                            maintain you grip.<br>
                            It will toss you around, drag you along, and throw you to the ground,<br>
                            grasp it harder.<br>
                            Hold on until your finger burn and your knuckles white,<br>
                            and expel any thought of relaxing your grip.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;">If you can, along the way, grab onto others,<br>
                            bring them along on your journey,<br>
                            allow them to indulge&nbsp;in the tailwinds of your happiness,<br>
                            But should the weight of others cause your grasp to faulter,<br>
                            release them immediately.<br>
                            For your happiness is your own and if ever you let it slide through your fingers,<br>
                            it may just escape for good.</p>
