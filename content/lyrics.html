                    <h3><strong>When It Feels Right</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        Breathe in, close your eyes<br>
                        If only, for the night<br>
                        So we can, make it right<br>
                        Cause they&rsquo;re tired of hearing this fight<br>
                        Cause if the California lovin just wasn&rsquo;t enough for you<br>
                        I got a place that was made for me and you<br>
                        Omniscient deities can&rsquo;t take you away<br>
                        If you&rsquo;re homeland dreams just weren&rsquo;t enough for you<br>
                        Expiration dates are upon you<br>
                        Listen to the lost boys and hear them sing</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus</em><br>
                        How far can we go<br>
                        And how long till we&rsquo;ll know<br>
                        Can we reap what we sow<br>
                        We could, but only when it feels right</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        Time will pass you by<br>
                        With bloodshed under the moonlit sky<br>
                        But don&rsquo;t let them hear you cry<br>
                        Cause fear is how they survive<br>
                        From the ocean's breeze to the neon trees just let me know and I will find you<br>
                        From your homeland dreams to your city schemes you can&rsquo;t let all of these things define you</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 2</em><br>

                    <p><em>Outro</em><br>
                        You can&rsquo;t let all of these things define you x4</p>

                    <h3><strong>Clockwork</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        There stood Clockwork, in all of his glory<br>
                        Looking down at all that he had done<br>
                        There stood two lovers at the end of the story<br>
                        Wondering what they had become<br>
                        A broken clock, two broken hearts, I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s come to this, ohhh<br>
                        They played the game, they lost their love, the enemy was just too big, ohhh<br>
                        But it can&rsquo;t end this way, but it can&rsquo;t end this way</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 1</em><br>
                        Not even time my dear, not even time can tear us apart<br>
                        Cause if we were meant to fail, we would&rsquo;ve failed from the start<br>
                        Not even time my dear, not even time can tear us away,<br>
                        From all the words that we&rsquo;ll say, from all the words that we&rsquo;ll never get to say<br>
                        Never get to say</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        &nbsp;And time goes by and I digress, I never did miss that pain in my chest,<br>
                        Giving up my heart was the best thing I could&rsquo;ve done<br>
                        And time goes by and I digress, I never did miss that pain in my chest<br>
                        Giving up my heart was the best cause now there&rsquo;s<br>
                        A broken clock two broken hearts, I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s come to this, ohhh<br>
                        They played the game, they lost their love, the enemy was just too big<br>
                    <p><em>Chorus 2</em><br></p>
                    <p><em>Bridge</em><br>
                        My baby she won&rsquo;t go (not even with time) x8</p>
                    <p><em>Guitar solo</em><br></p>
                    <p>Not even time my dear, not even time can tear us apart<br>
                        Cause if we were meant to fail, then Clockwork eat your heart out</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 3</em></p>

                    <h3><strong>The Mask</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>Chorus 1</em><br>
                        So let me lie or let me die, under a sky that&rsquo;s left me doomed<br>
                        Let me hold on too tight, let me, let go too soon<br>
                        Because I&rsquo;ve heard the devil laugh and I&rsquo;ve seen the angels cry<br>
                        So I&rsquo;ll wear this mask till the day that I die, I&rsquo;ll wear this mask till the day that I die</p>
                    <p><em>Verse</em><br>
                        Walking to the edge of the world alone, when the sky fell<br>
                        The people watched in horror as the world slipped from my back<br>
                        Walking down the city streets alone when the light ran<br>
                        Off to a place that never let me in<br>
                        I never knew the secrets told<br>
                        To those who knew how to listen close<br>
                        And I cannot see her face tonight<br>
                        Behind this mask that I&rsquo;ve been wearing my whole life<br>
                        The chitter chatter of the girls slips to the back of my mind<br>
                        I know I may never get to see their faces again<br>
                        I listen to the whisper of the mask as it tells me<br>
                        That I&rsquo;m going home alone tonight, yeah I&rsquo;m going home alone</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 2</em><br>
                    <p><em>Bridge</em><br>
                        Do you remember up North when the thunder spoke first, but we both got a word in too<br>
                        And as the heavens came down, we retreated for hell, and the devil cried now what shall I do with you two?<br>
                        He handed me the mask, gave me one simple task, he said just put it on and I&rsquo;ll let you through<br>
                        Do you remember what I did for you?<br>
                        Do you remember what I did to get us through?<br>
                        Do you remember what I did to get through to you?<br>
                        Because I do x4</p>

                        Hey, you calling my name, for shame, and it stings<br>
                        The games that you played, and the things that got away<br>
                        The soothsayer say, that the future doesn&rsquo;t look so bright for you and I<br>

                        Hey, is this all you have to offer me?<br>
                        I say hey, you&rsquo;re always wrestling in the back of my mind<br>

                        Baby you and I are always taking this into overtime</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        Who is to blame for this current situation?<br>
                        I&rsquo;m not sure who I like anymore or if I&rsquo;ll ever know<br>
                        Who is to blame for this current situation?<br>
                        I&rsquo;m not sure if I love you any more or if I&rsquo;ll ever know, so I&rsquo;ll say</p>

                        Mary, won&rsquo;t you throw all of your tears away?<br>
                        They flow, cause your eyes don&rsquo;t know what else to say<br>
                        And hey, is this all you have to offer me?<br>
                        Because if so why don&rsquo;t you set me free? And I&rsquo;ll say<br>

                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        Growing up fast in the middle of nowhere,<br>
                        parochial views can you please tell me what&rsquo;s in store?<br>
                        Growing up fast, wish I were going somewhere<br>
                        Then the future looks down like well what are you waiting for?</p>

                        It&rsquo;s coming now, get ready for this coming of age?<br>
                        It&rsquo;s coming now, can you feel this coming of age?<br>
                        Cause in this midnight, how dare you, walk away</p>
                    <p><em>Post-chorus</em><br>
                        And I&rsquo;ll see it from the watchtower where I&rsquo;ll finally feel my skin begin to grow cold<br>
                        But these vultures they won&rsquo;t wait much longer waiting for my body to grow old<br>
                        And I&rsquo;ll see you on the flipside when this life decides its time for me to go<br>
                        But if only I could see one more day, if only, I could see the snow<br>
                        One more time</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        My whole life reads like a vivacious novel<br>
                        Title page worn and the pictures are overdrawn<br>
                        But it&rsquo;ll tell a lot about the man I&rsquo;m becoming<br>
                        Ask me who I am and ill say, well what chapter you on?</p>

                        We move backwards for this feeling,<br>
                        We do the making and the healing<br>
                        And we are all that you will need in this life<br>

                        They&rsquo;re looking down upon us with a frown<br>

                        If you could stay round, and could feel our strife<br>

                        But frankly, that would take away the pleasure<br>
                        Of all our sinful endeavors,<br>
                        And we could never see this night through</p>

                        World he made so far away, he knew from a young age that he couldn&rsquo;t stay</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 1</em><br>
                        He goes to cry on the side of his open mind<br>
                        He can&rsquo;t come down<br>
                        He goes outside, looks towards the sky, opens his eyes<br>
                        He lives in the stars now</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        Julia born one morning early at dawn<br>
                        Poor girl came into this world alone, but didn&rsquo;t mind<br>
                        She didn&rsquo;t intend to stay long<br>
                        Julia tried to sing all her troubles away<br>
                        But every note that left was another breathe, that wouldn&rsquo;t seem to stay in her lungs<br>
                        Until she couldn&rsquo;t take it one night and at 9 p.m she tried to take her own life</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 2</em><br>
                        She&rsquo;s in a haze, her life&rsquo;s a maze, her mind&rsquo;s ablaze<br>
                        Her head is on fire<br>
                        She stops and stares, inhales the cold night air and knows<br>
                        She belongs up there</p>
                    <p><em>Bridge 1</em><br>
                        Then Oliver and Julia met one night,<br>
                        Two souls colliding under pale moonlight<br>
                        Then Julia screamed &ldquo;no one loves me here&rdquo;<br>
                        That&rsquo;s when Oliver whispered in her ear<br>

                    <p><em>Bridge 2</em><br>
                        We could run away, run away, run away my dear<br>
                        No need for us to stay in this place under the atmosphere<br>
                        We could run away to the stars up in the universe<br>
                        We could run away, run away, run away my dear<br>
                        No need for us to stay in this place they don&rsquo;t want us here<br>
                        We could run away to the stars up in the universe<br>
                        They&rsquo;ll never find us there x4<br>

                    <p><em>Bridge 3</em><br>
                        Then Julia screamed &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll follow us there&rdquo;<br>
                        It&rsquo;s a fever you can&rsquo;t sweat out<br>
                        But an idea once started is a treacherous thing,<br>
                        A seed, a plant, a tree in his mind<br>
                        Till Oliver saw only one way out<br>

                    <p><em>Bridge 4</em><br>

                        She sees him late one night, in the city way up high<br>
                        Defenestration<br>
                        She goes to his side, stares in his empty blue eyes and knows<br>
                        He lives in the stars</p>
                    <p><em>Outro</em><br>
                        Oliver died in the winter of 95</p>

                    <h3><strong>Ghost Army (Stargazzer Part ll)</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        He went on one knee, as to be understood<br>
                        To have and to hold, would she have him for good?<br>
                        And off of her feet, she was swept alright<br>
                        To love one another until eternal night<br>
                        A bride on her wedding, how she&rsquo;s waited so long<br>
                        Begins to hear whispers of those who&rsquo;ve already gone<br>
                        The ghost army says, won&rsquo;t you heed our words<br>
                        The life you&rsquo;ll live hear will never be of much worth</p>
                    <p><em>Chorus 1</em><br>
                        So come to us child, and make us your home<br>
                        So you will never sleep, never sleep alone<br>
                        A lesson in time, and a tragedy too<br>
                        This world wasn&rsquo;t made, wasn&rsquo;t made for you x2</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        So take off your shoes<br>
                        You won&rsquo;t need them here, the sea under you<br>
                        Indulge in your fill<br>
                        And watch as my soul bends to your will<br>
                        A moon made of gold<br>
                        And the taste of sweet honey as each other they hold<br>
                        From my eyes to the sea<br>
                        I see that this world wasn&rsquo;t meant for me<br>
                        Our toes in the sand<br>
                        I fear the ghost army&rsquo;s closing in<br>
                        Forever she must march<br>
                        Without her true love into the dark</p>

                        And I just don&rsquo;t mind<br>

                        So maybe we should pack our bags and go<br>
                        Cause this towns got me seeing from a new perspective<br>
                        And I just don&rsquo;t mind, I don&rsquo;t mind anymore</p>

                        We walked to the outskirts not making a sound<br>
                        And came across a sign that read, welcome to Snowtown<br>
                        Then I buried it six feet under ground<br>
                        And I knew in that moment, that I, was gonna turn my life around</p>

                        And I&rsquo;m bored to tears, I&rsquo;m bored to shame<br>
                        But what a shame it is that I begin to change<br>

                        You were the one, the only prodigal son<br>
                        Who always had a bad habit of letting the time fly,<br>
                        and pass him by.</p>
                    <p><em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
                        But don&rsquo;t you worry it gets better with age,<br>
                        just pray to god this sleeping giant never wakes</p>

                        Said I am but a foreigner and this life gets hard,<br>

                    <p><em>Chorus 1</em><br>
                        This is the night that you turn things around,<br>
                        as the moonlights turns sinful, and the sun gets shot down<br>
                        and the, pretty little girls, all dressed in their gowns,<br>
                        ready to poison my blood, with every single pound.<br>
                        And you sit alone, outside of your house,<br>
                        As your pretty little smile gets corrupted by a frown,<br>
                        and if you listen real close you can hear my footsteps,<br>
                        running away through town.<br>
                        As you become the girls who waited around.</p>
                    <p><em>Bridge</em><br>

                    <h3><strong>Poison *</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        Feelings they&rsquo;re only words, so why do they hurt<br>
                        more than the stick and pebbles they throw at you?<br>
                        They&rsquo;re rallying and gathering hope, building a moat,<br>
                        so that they lifeblood just can&rsquo;t get through.</p>
                    <p><em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
                        Poison, why you sip that poison?</p>
                    <p><em>Chrorus 1</em><br>
                        Cause they make you feel so empty inside,<br>
                        They occupy your head so there&rsquo;s nowhere to hide<br>
                        And they make you feel like you&rsquo;re living a lie,<br>
                        why you sip that poison?</p>
                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>
                        An open wound and it&rsquo;s just the start, see your tapestry heart<br>
                        as &nbsp;your true colors start to bleed through<br>
                        The chemicals they enter your veins, and I watch you strain<br>
                        as the poison overtakes you

                    <p><em>Verse 1</em><br>
                        They say that the ocean is only as wide as you make it<br>
                        Then I guess I’ve still got a long way to go<br>
                        They say that the desert is only as hot as you make it<br>
                        But I can’t take the heat anymore</p>
                    <p><em>Prechorus</em><br>
                        So listen close even when you’ve lost your ability to hear<br>
                        So listen close even when you’ve lost your ability to feel<br></p>

                    <p><em>Chorus</em><br>

                        Singing oh, oh oh<br>
                        I’ve been losing my sight for so long<br>
                        Singing oh, oh oh<br>
                        If seeing is believing is there really any hope left for me?</p>

                    <p><em>Verse 2</em><br>

                        They say that our love is only as strong as you make it<br>
                        So how could I have let you go away<br>
                        This gun on my shoulder tells two different stories<br>
                        How far we’ve come and how far we’ve yet to go</p>

                    <p><em>Prechorus</em><br>

                        So listen close even when you’ve lost your ability to feel<br>
                        So listen close even when you’ve lost your ability to love</p>
