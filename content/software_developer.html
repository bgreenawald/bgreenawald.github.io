									<i><h2>UVA Scheduler</h2></i>
									<p>This is the story of how I went from a cloud computing homework assignment to a free Echo Dot (sort of). It was
										my final undergraduate semester at UVA and I was taking
										a course on Cloud Computing. For one of our homework
										assignments, we were to develop an app for Amazon's Alexa
										to assist students in scheduling courses. A user could ask
										the app basic questions about a class and receive information
										about when that class was being held and who was teaching it.
										For the assignment, the Alexa API talked to an AWS Lambda
										function (written in Python) which then talked to a simulated
										MySQL database hosted by our professor. It was a really well-done assignment and certainly got our hands wet with AWS and
										Alexa.</p>

										<p>A few months after submission, I came across a promotion
										where there were giving away free Echo Dots and decided, with
										a few minor modifications, to submit the assignment. The app
										was almost in perfect working order, the back end just needed to be modified. Instead of pointing it towards the toy database, I needed
										to point it towards an up to date listing of classes being offered at UVA. UVA itself did not seem to have an easily accessible database like this, however, one of the professors at UVA had written a site that displays all of the class information pretty nicely, with consistent formatting and predictable URLs. So I ended up having it scrape this site instead of accessing a database. I realize the performance hit taken by doing this, but finding the class database
										seemed like it was going to be a pain, and I was honestly in it
										mostly for the experience and Echo Dot.</p>

										<p>At this point, the pipeline was, a user makes a query to their
										Alexa product about a certain UVA class. This query is sent to an
										AWS Lambda endpoint (still written in Python). The Lambda function scrapes the UVA class website (called louslist.com) and
										after some formatting, returns the response to the user. With
										the app complete, I submitted and after some drama with the app's
										name (turns out names can't sound like people's names so although Sammy Scheduler had a nice alliterative ring to it, it was indeed not valid), I submitted the app and received my Echo Dot (sort of). The Dot I was given has some sort of known Wifi bug so I need to call in
										and get a new one, but that is just not a top priority at the moment. I
										also realized that although the app is pretty cool, it is so much more
										efficient to just schedule through louslist.com directly or from some
										of the students made scheduling apps that I don't see a huge use
										case for an app like this, but it was a good experience with the Alexa
										API and AWS Lambda. Although I did find out that the next month,
										Amazon ran the same promotion the next month except now they
										offered an Echo Dot AND a pair of Alexa socks. So I guess the real
										moral of the story is.....procrastinators prosper?</p>

									<i><h2>UVA Grades App</h2></i>
									<p>This project is really the first personal project that I worked on. Midway through my second year in undergrad, I found out that
										students could access grade data from the University through
										the Freedom of Information Act. Indeed, with the completion of
										a single form, I was emailed 10 CSV files containing exactly what
										grades had been given out in every undergraduate class for the past
										5 years (as in, each row had class, professor name, section number, how many A's were given, how many B's, how many students dropped, GPA, etc.). I found this information incredibly cool and potentially quite
										useful to other students, so I decided to try and create a nice
										interface for this data. Some enterprising UVA students had already
										found great success create an app to help students schedule classes
										at UVA so the market for such student-created apps was definitely
										there.</p>

										<p>Two challenges immediately presented themselves. The first pertained to what technology to select for such a task as I had no
										experience hosting web apps and was overwhelmed by the number of different options available. I had really been itching to learn R, so I ended up choosing to develop in R using the Shiny framework for
										developing web apps. This also allowed me to use ggplot, the visualization library in R to show users graphs of the data.
										The second issue was that I've always
										had a minor weak spot when it comes to designing aesthetically
										pleasing, highly user-friendly apps. I acknowledge how important
										these aspects of an app are, but I generally prefer to focus on functionality, thus I enlisted the help of a friend in the UVA McIntire School of Commerce with an eye for design to help me out. I would
										be the developer and she the designer.</p>

										<p>With preliminary issues resolved, we dove into development.
										No surprise here, but a plethora of new issues quickly presented
										themselves after we started development. Firstly, how do we
										consolidate the 10 or so different CSVs into a single amalgamation
										of data that can be used by the program? I decided to write a
										separate script that performed this task once so that the program
										did not have to merge the CSV files every time it ran. Next, was how
										to deal with professors who taught more than one section of the
										same class within the semester? This led to more that one row in the
										data, however, it seemed like these should only be one observation.
										We decided on a row level merge for cases like this, where the
										individual letter grades were summed to form a single observation
										and GPA's were recomputed.</p>

										<p>Then we had to decide how to present this information to
										the user. After consulting with some friends, we decided to allow
										users to see a GPA over time graph for a given class by professor,
										and also a more detailed breakdown of the grade distribution.
										After a couple of iterations, we were closing in on an MVP. There
										were a few minor bugs that we wanted to address before release
										and we decided to reconvene after our respective summer internships
										to iron out the kinks. Unfortunately, during this time, someone
										released a very similar app that had grades for not only UVA but
										other VA schools as well. After confirming that the app did
										essentially the same thing that ours did, we decided to learn our
										lessons and scrap the project. I still gained valuable experience
										with developing apps with users in mind and also got in-depth
										experience in R and Shiny. We also both learned about the importance of getting a product to market as quickly as possible.

									<i><h2>Ghost Hunter App</h2></i>

									<p>Always good to remember where you started, right? This little
											app was the first ever "big" coding project I ever worked on. A
											team of myself and three others coded up this beauty as part
											of a second level programming class. A pretty simple premise, as you can probably ascertain from the gameplay screenshot.
											Ghost enemies progress down the screen, shooting bullets at
											your character, who is controlled by tilting the accelerometer
											enabled Android device. You can, of course, fire back to eliminate the ghosts before they cross the bottom of the screen.
											You lose a life every time a ghost makes it all the way down the
											screen or you are shot by an enemy bullet. As mentioned, this
											project was developed in Android, which is written in Java. We
											used git for our source control, although we really only wrote
											code on a single machine when we were all together, so git
											and Github ended up being a little bit redundant, but good experience nonetheless. This project also introduced me to
											Async tasks, which are Android's version of multithreading. My
											implementation ended up being extremely clunky and the
											game still lags if too many enemies are on the board, but this
											my first time with a program that needed more than one thread, so cut me some slack. This code runs on a really old
											version of Android so really doesn't work anymore :( It took me
											a couple of hours just to get everything configured right just to
											get the app running long enough to get the screenshots. So
											while the code base is essentially dead, I still like to keep it around to help show my development.</p>
