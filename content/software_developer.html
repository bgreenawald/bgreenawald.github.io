									<p>Always good to remember where you started, right? This little
											app was the first ever "big" coding project I ever worked on. A
											team of myself and three others coded up this beauty as part
											of a second level programming class. A pretty simple premise, as you can probably ascertain from the gameplay screenshot.
											Ghost enemies progress down the screen, shooting bullets at
											your character, who is controlled by tilting the accelerometer
											enabled Android device. You can, of course, fire back to eliminate the ghosts before they cross the bottom of the screen.
											You lose a life every time a ghost makes it all the way down the
											screen or you are shot by an enemy bullet. As mentioned, this
											project was developed in Android, which is written in Java. We
											used git for our source control, although we really only wrote
											code on a single machine when we were all together, so git
											and Github ended up being a little bit redundant, but good experience nonetheless. This project also introduced me to
											Async tasks, which are Android's version of multithreading. My
											implementation ended up being extremely clunky and the
											game still lags if too many enemies are on the board, but this
											my first time with a program that needed more than one thread, so cut me some slack. This code runs on a really old
											version of Android so really doesn't work anymore :( It took me
											a couple of hours just to get everything configured right just to
											get the app running long enough to get the screenshots. So
											while the code base is essentially dead, I still like to keep it around to help show my development.</p>
