                            <h2>Musician</h2>
                            <p>Music, both writing and playing, has been a cathartic hobby
                                of mine for almost a decade now. I started playing guitar in
                                middle school, which remains my primary instrument. I
                                casually picked up piano a few years later and although I
                                am competent, my musical theory and music reading abilities
                                need some work. I also have or have ready access to a mandolin,
                                a bass guitar, a ukelele, a synthesizer, and a drum set, all of which
                                I mostly noodle around on. Even though I have written music for
                                many years, I have only recently gotten more serious about
                                composing and recording the things that I have written. As of now,
                                music continues to be something I do for myself but may share
                                some of it on this site in the future! Until then, my lyrics
                                can be found <a href="lyrics.html">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>I am a big fan video games. I'm a big fan of tweaking things to my liking. So it's no
                                surprise that I am also a big fan of video game modding. At some
                                point or another, I have had a custom modded version of every
                                Super Smash Bros. game (except SSBM 64), with the biggest
                                project being a Smash 4 mod, titled <a href=" https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/5697">Super Smash Bros. SE.</a> We have released the
                                Beta but the project is currently on hiatus because my co-modder
                                moved to Seattle and school for me has taken priority. But as
                                the modding community discovers more and more about the game,
                                I hope to update the mod accordingly.</p>

                            <h2>Gamer</h2>
                            <p>After reading the above, it should come as no surprise that I also consider myself a gamer, with the
                                Smash Bros series and its derivatives being my all time favorites.
                                I don't play them all that much as I do consider them a low priority in my life,
                                but getting together with a group of friends to just hang out and play for awhile remains one of my favorite activities. You can find me
                                on Steam, username S0MA (10 points to anyone who gets the reference).
                                The only game I am currently active on is Rivals of Aether where I main Zetterburn and Etalus.<br>
                                <img src="../images/rivals.PNG"><br>
                                Like everyone and their mother, I play a little bit of Fortnite (tag 'bgreenawald'), though I would not say I'm active or skilled in it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Of course, video games are not the only kinds of games out there
                                and I enjoy all kinds! Board games, card games, miscellaneous games, and yes, the occasional drinking game. For board games my favorites
                                are Catan (though that game really stretches my attention span), and
                                Dixit. For card games, I like Capitalism, Beananza, Codenames, Oh Hell, Polish Poker (not actually sure if that's what it's called), and actual poker
                                (most variants). For miscellaneous games, my sisters and I are
                                voracious Bananagrams players. As a winter break project, we
                                (well, mostly my sisters, but I helped) created custom tiles that
                                stick together using command strips to make board rearrangement easier.

                            <p>
                                Writing, outside of songwriting, is one of my biggest love-hate
                                relationships in this world. When I was younger, my English teachers always told me I was a talented wordsmith (now whether
                                this was actually the truth, or just validation given to the well-behaved child remains to be seen), but I honestly never really
                                enjoyed traditional writing styles. Anytime I needed to express
                                myself, it was always more naturally done through songwriting.
                                But sometimes I do have an idea better expressed in either a
                                short story or poem. Occasionally, I will challenge myself to write
                                something every day just to spark creativity and, occasionally, I
                                will stumble across something written during these times and actually like it. And even though most of the times I feel expressed
                                after only a paragraph short story or succinct poem, it is a minor
                                bucket list item of mine to write something more substantial. For
                                now, I have a page of some of my writing <a href="writing.html">here</a>.
