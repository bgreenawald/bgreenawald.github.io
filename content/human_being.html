									<h2>Musician</h2>
									<p>Music, both writing and playing, has been a cathartic hobby
										of mine for almost a decade now. I started playing guitar in
										middle school, which remains my primary instrument. I
										casually picked up piano a few years later and although I
										am competent, my musical theory and music reading abilities
										need some work. I also have or have ready access to a mandolin,
										a bass guitar, a ukelele, a synthesizer, and a drum set, all of which
										I mostly noodle around on. Even though I have written music for
										many years, I have only recently gotten more serious about
										composing and recording the things that I have written. As of now,
										music continues to be something I do for myself but may share
										some of it on this site in the future!</p>

									<h2>Modder</h2>
									<p>I am a big fan video games. I'm a big fan of tweaking things to my liking. So it's no
										surprise that I am also a big fan of video game modding. At some
										point or another, I have had a custom modded version of every
										Super Smash Bros. game (except SSBM 64), with the biggest
										project being a Smash 4 mod, titled <a href=" https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/5697">Super Smash Bros. SE.</a>. We have released the
										Beta but the project is currently on hiatus because my co-modder
										moved to Seattle and school for me has taken priority. But as
										the modding community discovers more and more about the game,
										I hope to update the mod accordingly.</p>

									<h2>Gamer</h2>
									<p>After reading the above, it should come as no surprise that I also consider myself a gamer, with the
											Smash Bros series and its derivatives being my all time favorites.
											I don't play them all that much as I do consider them a low priority in my life,
											but getting together with a group of friends to just hang out and play for awhile remains one of my favorite activities. You can find me
											on Steam, username S0MA (10 points to anyone who gets the reference).
											The only game I am currently active on is Rivals of Aether where I main Zetterburn and Etalus.<br>
