                        <p>I've played poker pretty regularly ever since some friends
                            and I tried penny poker back in Junior year of high school. This
                            largely stagnated when I came to college. However, a friend recently
                            reached out and expressed interest in playing after seeing Jessica
                            Chastain being a badass in Aaron Sorkin's movie <i>Molly's Game</i>.
                            I was super psyched to set up some sort of game but realized it might be tricky to set anything up since a lot of college kids, myself
                            included, don't really want to spend money on a buy-in poker game.
                            We could easily just play with chips that have no real money behind them, but I have found that poker really isn't fun without
                            some tangible risk. Naturally, the next thing I though of was a drinking game.</p>

                            <p>Now I scoured the internet looking for a good way to play poker
                            as a drinking game, but could not find anything enticing. This
                            is the sort of thing I thought TotalFratMove existed for, but, like most
                            things involving TFM, was disappointed. So, I decided to come up with my own poker-drinking game. There a few challenges intrinsic
                            to any drinking game involving poker that I needed to address when designing this game. The first being, it needs to be
                            simple enough that intoxicated people can play it. Poker is pretty complicated as is and adding more layers of complexity would make it infeasible for anyone under the influence. Second, it needs to
                            have some sort of evening of the playing field. Poker, especially when played with people of varying skill levels, can quickly become a lopsided game, which could be dangerous if people drink based on
                            performance, so there needs to be an equalizing factor. Finally, it
                            still needs to feel like poker. If you strip away chips and betting and
                            strategy, you aren't playing poker anymore. I wanted anything I created to retain the feel of poker. Admittedly, even these three criteria
                            were very hard to reconcile all at once, but below is a good start. Without further ado, I present, <strong><i>Socialist Drinking Poker</i></strong>.</p>


                            <p><strong>Throughout these rules, I describe the rules as though each chip has monetary value. Even though the point of this game is that chips have no actual monetary value, I find it is easiest to play as though they do, just as that is what most people are used to.</strong></p>

                            <h3>Setup:</h3>
                            <p><ol>
                                <li>3-6 players, 4 or more is ideal</li>
                                <li>A deck of cards</li>
                                <li>Sippable alcohol</li>
                                <li>A piece of paper and pen (or phone)</li>
                            </ol></p>

                            On top of this, you need to select a chip to drink
                            conversion ratio (CSR). This is entirely dependent on your
                            setup, but if you are playing using money for chip values
                            and giving everyone between 5-10 "dollars" worth of chips,
                            then a conversion ratio of 15-20 cents is most appropriate.
                            Further, you need to select a Big
                            Betting Round Fee, described later on. This minimum buy-in
                            should be a multiple of the chip to drink conversion rate. Using the values above, I recommend a multiple of 5, corresponding to 75-100 cents.<br><br>

                            <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                            <p>The gameplay can be broken down into three stages. Normal
                            gameplay, Big Betting Rounds (BBR), and Endgame. Any of these
                            stages can be modified to fit your needs and I intend this only to
                            serve as a template.</p>

                            <h3>Normal Gameplay</h3>
                            <p>The majority of the game is played almost identically to normal
                            poker. The game is dealer's choice and the dealer can choose any game, even a made up one, so long as everyone understands the rules and the game is fair. We recommend playing antes so you don't have to keep up with blinds. On any round, there is a one sip penalty for folding and a 3-sip penalty if you stay in until the end and lose.</p>

                            <h3>Big Betting Rounds</h3>
                            <p>Big Betting Rounds (BBRs) are the biggest change from normal poker
                            and meant to level the playing field a bit (hence Socialist Drinking
                            Poker).  If <i>n</i> is the number of players playing, then BBRs should
                            occur every <i>n + 1</i> rounds if you have 3-4 players, or every <i>n - 1</i> rounds for more than 4 players.  In order to make BBRs work, someone needs to keep track of who wins each round. The player or players who have won the most rounds since the last BBR <i>including</i> the last BBR must play the BBR. At the start of the
                            BBR, every player may enter in an initial bet into the pot instead of an ante. These players may then give out drinks equal to their bet
                            divided by the chip to sip ratio (CSR), rounded down. So if the CSR
                            is 15 cents and a player puts in 17 cents, then they may give out one
                            sip since 17/15 rounds down to 1. Those players who have won the
                            most rounds since the last BBR <i>must</i> put in at least the BBR Fee established at the beginning of the game, and give out sips accordingly. So if the BBR fee is 100 cents, the player(s) who have
                            won the most rounds since and including the last BBR must put in at
                            least 100 cents and give out sips according to how much they put in,
                            divided by 15 and rounded down. From there, the round continues
                            as normal except that the penalty for folding is four sips, strongly
                            encouraging people to play out the round.</p>

                            <h3>Endgame</h3>
                            <p>The game ends when either the first person runs out of chips, or a
                            prespecified number of BBRs have passed. At this point, everyone
                            should count up their chips and players are ranked accordingly.
                            Since at this point, people are probably decently tipsy, I recommend
                            using a simple template for drinking where the winner drinks no sips, second place drinks 2 sips, third takes 4 sips, and so on with the
                            only caveat being that the overall loser takes a shot.</p>
