                            I have this disease late at night sometimes,
                            involving alcohol and the telephone. <i>Page 5</i>

                            It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say
                            about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything
                            ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is,
                            except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre,
                            things like “Poo-tee-weet?”

                            I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction. The sun
                            was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar, I read. Then the Lord rained upon
                            Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew
                            those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew
                            upon the ground. So it goes. Those were vile people in both those cities, as is well known.
                            The world was better off without them. And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back
                            where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for
                            that, because it was so human. So she was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.
                            <i>Page 27</i>

                            The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only
                            appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to
                            cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will
                            exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at
                            a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments
                            are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have
                            here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a
                            moment is gone it is gone forever. “When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is
                            that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person
                            is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I
                            simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ‘So it goes.’

                            All this responsibility at such an early age made her a bitchy flibbertigibbet.

                            This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through
                            the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn’t anybody
                            else there, or any thing. There was just violet light—and a hum.
                            <i>Page 54</i>

                            From there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his
                            decrepit mother at Pine Knoll, an old people’s home he had put her in only a month before.
                            She had caught pneumonia, and wasn’t expected to live. She did live, though, for years after
                            that. Her voice was nearly gone, so, in order to hear her, Billy had to put his ear right
                            next to her papery lips. She evidently had something very important to say. “How … ?” she
                            began, and she stopped. She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn’t have to say the rest
                            of the sentence, that Billy would finish it for her. But Billy had no idea what was on her
                            mind. “How what, Mother?” he prompted. She swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she
                            gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even from her toes and fingertips. At last
                            she had accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence: “How did I get so old?”
                            <i>Page 55</i>

                            Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going,
                            even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on
                            Billy’s wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too. It went like this: GOD GRANT
                            ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE, COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN,
                            AND WISDOM ALWAYS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE. Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change
                            were the past, the present, and the future.
                            <i>Page 76</i>

                            “Welcome aboard, Mr. Pilgrim,” said the loudspeaker. “Any questions?” Billy licked his lips,
                            thought a while, inquired at last: “Why me?” “That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr.
                            Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have
                            you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?” “Yes.” Billy, in fact, had a paperweight in his office
                            which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it. “Well, here we are,
                            Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”
                            <i>Page 97</i>

                        <li>
                            Listen—on the tenth night the peg was pulled out of the hasp on Billy’s boxcar door, and the
                            door was opened. Billy Pilgrim was lying at an angle on the corner-brace, self-crucified,
                            holding himself there with a blue and ivory claw hooked over the sill of the ventilator.
                            Billy coughed when the door was opened, and when he coughed he shit thin gruel. This was in
                            accordance with the Third Law of Motion according to Sir Isaac Newton. This law tells us
                            that for every action there is a reaction which is equal and opposite in direction. This can
                            be useful in rocketry.

                        <li>
                            “Where am I?” said Billy Pilgrim. “Trapped in another blob of amber, Mr. Pilgrim. We are
                            where we have to be just now—three hundred million miles from Earth, bound for a time warp
                            which will get us to Tralfamadore in hours rather than centuries.” “How—how did I get here?”
                            “It would take another Earthling to explain it to you. Earthlings are the great explainers,
                            explaining why this event is structured as it is, telling how other events may be achieved
                            or avoided. I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky
                            Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or
                            explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as
                            I’ve said before, bugs in amber.” “You sound to me as though you don’t believe in free
                            will,” said Billy Pilgrim. •  •  • “If I hadn’t spent so much time studying Earthlings,”
                            said the Tralfamadorian, “I wouldn’t have any idea what was meant by ‘free will.’ I’ve
                            visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one
                            hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.”

                            She upset Billy simply by being his mother. She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and
                            weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to keep that life going,
                            and Billy didn’t really like life at all.

                            So Rosewater told him. It was The Gospel from Outer Space, by Kilgore Trout. It was about a
                            visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian, by the way. The visitor
                            from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians
                            found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod
                            storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach
                            people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low. But the Gospels
                            actually taught this: Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isn’t well
                            connected. So it goes.

                            “I’m proud you were a soldier. Do you know that?” “Good.” “Was it awful?” “Sometimes.” A
                            crazy thought now occurred to Billy. The truth of it startled him. It would make a good
                            epitaph for Billy Pilgrim—and for me, too. "Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt."

                            So Billy experiences death for a while. It is simply violet light and a hum. There isn’t
                            anybody else there. Not even Billy Pilgrim is there.

                            There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because
                            most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces.
                            One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being
                            characters. But old Derby was a character now.

                            leaves. Its flowers were government bonds. Its fruit was diamonds. It attracted human beings

                            that in you, which may be why I led you around in circles so much. <i>Page 115</i>

                            live on, stung that she was not the reason. She would never leave her mark on Mammy’s heart
                            the way her brothers had, because Mammy’s heart was like a pallid beach where Laila’s
                            footprints would forever wash away beneath the waves of sorrow that swelled and crashed,
                            swelled and crashed.

                            All day, this poem about Kabul has been bouncing around in my head. Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it
                            back in the seventeenth century, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but all I can
                            remember now is two lines: “One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the
                            thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.

                            Seasons had come and gone; presidents in Kabul had been inaugurated and murdered; an empire
                            had been defeated; old wars had ended and new ones had broken out. But Mariam had hardly
                            noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind. A dry,
                            barren field, out beyond wish and lament, beyond dream and disillusionment. There, the
                            future did not matter. And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake,
                            and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers
                            began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them
                            and ditched them before they took hold.

                            been unkind to her. But as she walked the final twenty paces, she could not help but wish
                            for more of it.

                            our own work, and perhaps that is why we see in the increasing complexity of our mental
                            constructs a means for greater understanding, even while intuitively we know that we shall
                            never be able to fathom the imponderables that govern our course through life.

                            No matter how often I tell myself that chance happenings of this kind occur far more often
                            than we suspect, since we all move, one after the other, along the same roads mapped out for
                            us by our origins and our hopes, my rational mind is nonetheless unable to lay the ghosts of

                            something. If you’re sitting there, miserable day after day, then that means you’re already
                            wrong about something major in your life, and until you’re able to question yourself to find

                            there is also no reason to not do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death,
                            there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all

                            fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend,
                            why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship's some key to happiness.

                            them. Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you

                            I'm acting, the way I sound. And I don't know how to change it. And I'm so scared... That
